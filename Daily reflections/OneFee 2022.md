* Reason: we have a OneFee model when it was direct consumer service (2019) but in 2020 we took up FinAdvisors
* We tell the finAdvisors to give us their small customers
* Issue; 1.5% range - upsetting finadvisors at the moment

More revenue by increasing the bottom fee
* Two fee models; one for finAdvisors and customers


UI changes

-> OneFee affect the outcome 


Planning meeting | devs and cals

-> Fee Template table
- Seed: for existing clients (you may even create a historic table but there's problems) then after inserts and updates

Next year:
* For tracking, we'll use the audit table to get the history of the clients to have the input for the fee structures (batch update would also on the looming)
		* When a client switches from being advised by FA to OUT
* Reveal page there'll be the latest ONEfee option (the charged)

Summary
* Reveal calc happy
