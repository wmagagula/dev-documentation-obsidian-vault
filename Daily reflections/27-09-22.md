What went well?

- Beautiful time with the team. The congratulations I got to enjoy for being permanent were very nice. OUTsurance is such a nice place to work at, just the environment and the support is amazing. Think 15 years is on the horizon.
- Managed to get help from the guys, Lwanele's teammates. 

What didn't go well?

- Nothing really. All was well
